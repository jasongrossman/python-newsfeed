# Python-Newsfeed
Powered by Python, users can create their own accounts and share tech news on a social media feed. Users can post links to external sources, and there is a built in commenting function to create engagement on your posts.

Users are authenticated using bcrypt, and persisted through session storage.

Built using the Flask microframework for APIs.
